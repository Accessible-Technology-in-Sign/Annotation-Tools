### Database setup

In a seperate terminal, `cd` into the `flask_app` folder and create a virtual python environment. After activating this environement, run `pip install requirements.txt`. This will install all dependencies necessary.
Then, run `python3 app.py`.

Currently, we use a MySQL database, make sure you have MySQL installed on your computer. 
In the `flask_app/config.py` file, change `USER` and `PSWD` to match your local setup.
